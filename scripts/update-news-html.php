 "The substance of the Web is more and more residing in databases, and there
 are a variety of methods used to generate Web pages. This year, we selected a

<h1>PHP 3.0 Released</h1>
<p>
 <span class="newsdate">[06-Jun-1998]</span>
 PHP 3.0 is finally here! After 10 months of development PHP Version 3.0
 is ready for production environments. Coupled with the release of the
 final version of Apache-1.3.0 today, the combination provides an
 unbeatable web hosting platform suitable for both small and large web
 sites.
</p>
<p>
 PHP 3.0 is the latest evolution of the PHP/FI 2.0 language and it offers
 some dramatic enhancements. It is more than twice as fast, it uses less
 memory, it has a more consistent language implementation and a much wider
 set of expressions and language features than PHP/FI 2.0. An included
 conversion program will help you migrate your PHP 2 scripts to PHP 3.

 than the fact that PHP is used as the Web scripting language, but it has an interesting
 description of how they built a large scaleable system and it proves nicely that PHP
 is up to the task of being part of such a large-scale deployment.

<h1>PHP 3.0.11 has been released!</h1>
<p>
 <span class="newsdate">[27-Jun-1999]</span>
 Hot on the heels of 3.0.10, along comes another release
 to fix a few problems on Windows and some Unix platforms. If 3.0.10
 worked for you, there\'s probably no need to upgrade. 3.0.10 featured
 bug fixes, including the last of the fsockopen() and URL fopen()
 problems, we hope. The dbm database abstraction layer had the mode
 flag for dba_open() brought into line with dbm_open(), which means
 "w" will not create a non-existent database (use "c" instead). The
 documentation has also been moved into its own repository, and the
 generated HTML documentation is included in the tar.gz instead of the
 SGML source. For a more complete list of all of the changes, see the
 ChangeLog.

<h1>PHP 4.2.2 released in response to vulnerability</h1>

<p>
 <span class="newsdate">[22-Jul-2002]</span> The PHP Group today announced
 the details of a serious <a href="release_4_2_2.php">vulnerability</a> in
 PHP versions 4.2.0 and 4.2.1. A security update, <a href="downloads.php">PHP
 4.2.2</a>, fixes the issue. Everyone running affected versions of PHP is
 encouraged to upgrade immediately. The new 4.2.2 release doesn\'t include
 other changes, so upgrading from 4.2.1 is safe and painless.

<h1>New comp.lang.php newsgroup started</h1>

<p>
 <span class="newsdate">[09-Jul-2002]</span> comp.lang.php was created yesterday,
 after a two and a half month long process started in April by Ian Fette resulted in a
 <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=comp.lang.php&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;selm=1025483879.39561&amp;40isc.org&amp;rnum=3">177-11
 vote</a> in favor of the group. The new group is already carried on most news servers,
 and should be carried on almost all news servers in the world within the next few days.
</p>

<p>
 The new group is important for a few reasons: Firstly, the old alt.* php
 groups suffered from poor propagation - i.e. not all servers carried them,
 and the community was split between multiple groups. This new group offers a
 chance to unite the PHP-Usenet community. Secondly, most servers have longer
 post-retention times for comp.* than alt.*. Finally, the creation of
 comp.lang.php represents PHP\'s coming to acceptance and maturity. Virtually
 all languages have a spot under the comp.lang.* hierarchy. Stop on by and
 become a part of the community - comp.lang.php is a great place to get help
 and to help others.

<h1>Alpha 2 of PHP w/ the Zend Engine 2 Now Available</h1>
<p>
 <span class="newsdate">[30-Jun-2002]</span>
 The second alpha release of PHP w/ Zend Engine 2 is <a href="http://www.php.net/downloads.php">now
 available</a>. It is based on the current PHP 4 CVS (4.3.0-dev) and includes the new 
 scripting engine which greatly improves the object model, adds exception
 handling and provides a much better infrastructure for the integration
 of external technologies like Java or .NET. For more details and
 examples you can check out the <a href="http://www.php.net/zend-engine-2.php">file describing
 the changes</a>.
</p>

<p>
 <strong>Note:</strong> This is an alpha version. It should not be used in production
 or even semi-production web sites. There are known bugs in it, and in
 addition, some of the features may change (based on feedback). We
 encourage you to download and play with it (and report bugs if you find any!),
 but please don\'t expect it to replace your copy of PHP 4 at this stage.

<h1>My PHP.net</h1>

<p>
 <span class="newsdate">[24-Apr-2003]</span>
 The PHP website and mirrors sites now have a
 \'<a href="http://www.php.net/my.php">My PHP.net</a>\' page, which allows
 you to check what language settings you have, and enables
 you to set one which will override all the other detected
 parameters.
</p>

<p>
 However, normally this is not needed, as we remember the
 language you used last time. Be sure to have cookies turned
 on for PHP.net to let this feature work!

<h1>Grant Program</h1>

<p>
 <span class="newsdate">[06-Mar-2003]</span>
 <a href="http://www.phparch.com">php|architect</a>, is proud to
 announce the creation of the php|architect Grant Program, whose goal is
 to provide financial support to best-of-breed PHP-related projects.
</p>

<p>
 Participation in the program is open to all open-source projects
 that are related to PHP (but not necessarily written <i>in</i> PHP). The
 program is accepting submissions now and will start distributing grants
 in June of 2003.
</p>

<p>
 For more information, visit the <a 
 href="http://www.phparch.com/grant/">program\'s website</a>.

<h1>Set your own language preference</h1>

<p>
 <span class="newsdate">[01-Mar-2003]</span>
 Starting from today, your browser\'s "Accept Language" setting is also
 honored on language sensitive pages on the php.net site. If you would
 like to get to the documentation page of echo for example, you can use
 the <a href="http://www.php.net/echo">/echo</a> shortcut on all mirror sites, if your
 browser is set to provide your language preference information to the
 server. This also makes the PHP error message links point to the
 documentation in your preferred language.
</p>

<p>
 You can set your preferences under Edit/Preferences/Navigator/Languages
 in Mozilla, and under Tools/Internet Options/Languages in Internet
 Explorer. This will probably also enhance your web experience on sites
 providing translated content.

<h1>A Note on Security in PHP</h1>

<p>
 <span class="newsdate">[31-Dec-2004]</span>
 The PHP Development Team has issued an <a href="http://www.php.net/security-note.php">important
 statement</a> that deals with the security of PHP, and of PHP-based applications.
 The trigger for releasing this statement was the growing misconception in the PHP
 community regarding recent security problems, which exploited bugs
 in PHP applications, rather than bugs in PHP itself.  It\'s a recommended read
 for anybody using PHP.

<h1>Function list suggestions available</h1>
<p>
 <span class="newsdate">[27-Dec-2004]</span>
 Surely, some of our visitors are back at work for a few days between

 The function list suggestions we started to test a year ago seemed to
 be working better as some bugs were found and fixed, so it was time to
 make the result available on all php.net pages.
</p>
<p>
 Whenever you type something into the search field, while having the
 function list search option selected, you will get a list of suggested
 functions starting with the letters you typed in. You can browse the list
 with the up/down keys, and you will be able to autocomplete the function
 name with the spacebar.

<h1>PHP 4.4.0 Released</h1>
<p>
 <span class="newsdate">[11-Jul-2005]</span>
 The PHP Development Team would like to announce the immediate release of 
 <a href="http://www.php.net/downloads.php#v4">PHP 4.4.0</a>. 
 This is a maintenance release that addresses a serious memory corruption
 problem within PHP concerning references. If references were used in a wrong
 way, PHP could create memory corruptions which would not always surface or
 be visible. The increased middle digit was required because the fix that
 corrected the problem with references changed PHP\'s internal API, breaking
 binary compatibility with the PHP 4.3.* series. PHP 4.4.0 does not have
 any new features, and is solely a bugfix release; however, it is strongly
 recommended that you read the more detailed release announcement
 <a href="release_4_4_0.php">available here</a> prior to upgrading your
 PHP 4 installation.
</p>
<p>
For changes in PHP 4.4.0 since PHP 4.3.11, please consult the
<a href="http://www.php.net/ChangeLog-4.php#4.4.0">PHP 4 ChangeLog</a>.

<h1>PEAR XML_RPC Vulnerability and PHP 4.4.0RC2 release</h1>
<p>
 <span class="newsdate">[01-Jul-2005]</span>
 An easily exploitable security issue was discovered in PEAR XML_RPC &lt;=
 1.3.0.  We recommend that users of this PEAR class immediately upgrade to the
 latest version with:
</p>
<pre>
 pear upgrade XML_RPC
</pre>
<p>
 The same security problem exists in many other XML RPC implementations,
 please check if the installed applications that you use might have a
 similar problem.
</p>
<p>
 The new PEAR XML_RPC package is also bundled with the second release
 candidation of PHP 4.4.0RC2. Besides this new PEAR package there are two
 minor issues fixed since PHP 4.4.0RC1. As the improved reference support
 in PHP 4.4 might show as notices and warnings in your existing
 applications - in cases where PHP formerly just silently ignored this
 and often causing memory corruptions - we also recommend to test PHP
 4.4.0RC2 with your applications. The final release is planned for July
 11th. PHP 4.4.0RC2 can be found <a href="http://qa.php.net/~derick/">here</a>.

    <div>
  <span class="newsdate">[14-Apr-2007]</span>
  <p>
    The PHP team is once again proud to participate in the 
    <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">Google Summer of Code</a>.
    Seven students will "flip bits instead of burgers" this summer:

</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
        Mentored by Michael Wallner, Hannes Magnusson will work on
        <a href="http://wiki.phpdoc.info/LiveDocs">LiveDocs</a>, which is a
        "tool to display DocBook XML files in a web browser on the
        fly, without the need of building all HTML target files first".
        This project will be of great value to the PHP Documentation Team.
  </li>
    <li>
        The PHP Interpreter uses reference counting to keep track of which
        objects are no longer referenced and thus can be destroyed. A major
        weakness in the current implementation is that it cannot detect
        reference cycles, that is objects that reference each other in a
        circular graph structure which is not referenced itself from outside
        the circle. Mentored by Derick Rethans, David Wang will implement a
        new reference counting algorithm that will alleviate this problem.
  </li>
    <li><a href="http://xdebug.org/">Xdebug</a> provides a range of useful
        functionality for PHP developers, including detailed error information,
        code coverage and profiling support, and support for remote debugging
        using the GDB and DBGp protocols. Mentored by Xdebug\'s creator,
        Derick Rethans, Adam Harvey will develop a cross-platform GUI
        application that implements the DBGp protocol and allows PHP
        applications to be debugged using Xdebug in a development environment
        agnostic fashion.
  </li>

    <li>
	    Mentored by Lukas Smith, Konsta Vesterinen will work on the
        object-relational mapper <a href="http://www.phpdoctrine.net/">Doctrine</a>.
  </li>
    <li>
        Mutation Testing, or Automated Error Seeding, is an approach where
        the testing tool makes some change to the tested code, runs the tests,
        and if the tests pass displays a message saying what it changed. This
        approach is different than code coverage analysis, because it can find
        code that is executed by the running of tests but not actually tested.
        Mentored by Sebastian Bergmann, Mike Lewis will implement Mutation
        Testing for <a href="http://www.phpunit.de/">PHPUnit</a>.
  </li>
    <li>
        Mentored by Helgi Þormar Þorbjörnsson, Igor Feghali will add support
        for foreign keys to
        <a href="http://pear.php.net/package/MDB2_Schema/">MDB2_Schema</a>,
        a package that "enables users to maintain RDBMS independant schema
        files in XML that can be used to create, alter and drop database
        entities and insert data into a database".
  </li>

    <li>
        Mentored by David Coallier, Nicolas Bérard-Nault will refactor the
        internals of <a href="http://www.jaws-project.com/">Jaws</a>, a
        Framework and Content Management System for building dynamic web sites,
        for PHP 6.
  </li>
  </ul>

The majority of the security vulnerabilities discovered and resolved can in
most cases be only abused by local users and cannot be triggered remotely.
However, some of the above issues can be triggered remotely in certain
situations, or exploited by malicious local users on shared hosting setups
utilizing PHP as an Apache module. Therefore, we strongly advise all users of
PHP, regardless of the version to upgrade to the 5.2.1 or 4.4.5 releases as soon as possible.

        <p>The PHP development team is proud to announce the <a href="http://qa.php.net/">third alpha release</a>

        of the upcoming PHP 5.3.0 minor version update of PHP.
        Several new features have already been documented in the <a href="http://php.net/docs.php">official documentation</a>,
        others are listed on the <a href="http://wiki.php.net/doc/scratchpad/upgrade/53">wiki</a>
        in preparation of getting documented. It is imperative that more people
        join the effort to complete the documentation for PHP 5.3.0.
        Please also review the <a href="http://php.net/php5news">NEWS</a> file.</p>
        <strong>THIS IS A DEVELOPMENT PREVIEW - DO NOT USE IT IN PRODUCTION!</strong>
        <p>The purpose of this alpha release is to encourage users to not only actively
         participate in identifying bugs, but also in ensuring that all new features or
         necessary backwards compatibility breaks are noted in the documentation. Please
         report any findings to the <a href="mailto:php-qa@lists.php.net">QA mailinglist</a>

         or the <a href="http://bugs.php.net">bug tracker</a>.</p>
        <p>There have been a great number of other additions and improvements since the last alpha,
        but here is a short overview of the most important changes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="http://php.net/language.namespaces">Namespaces</a> (documentation has been updated to the current state)</li>
          <li>

            <a href="http://wiki.php.net/rfc/rounding">Rounding behavior</a>
          </li>
          <li>ext/msql has been removed, while ext/ereg will now raise E_DEPRECATED notices</li>
          <li>ext/mhash has been replaced by ext/hash but full BC is maintained</li>
          <li>PHP now uses cc as the default compiler, instead of gcc</li>
          <li>A number of bug fixes to ext/pdo, ext/soap, the stream layer among others</li>

        </ul>
        <p>Several under the hood changes also require in depth testing with existing
        applications to ensure that any backwards compatibility breaks are minimized.</p>

        <div>
        <p>The PHP development team is proud to announce the <a href="http://qa.php.net/">first alpha release</a> of the upcoming minor version update of PHP. <a href="http://windows.php.net/download/">Windows binaries</a> will be available starting with alpha2 (intermediate snapshots available at <a href="http://snaps.php.net">snaps.php.net</a>). The new version PHP 5.3 is expected to improve stability and performance as well as add new language syntax and extensions. Several new features have already been documented in the <a href="http://php.net/docs.php">official documentation</a>, others are listed on the <a href="http://wiki.php.net/doc/scratchpad/upgrade/53">wiki</a> in preparation of getting documented. Please also review the <a href="http://php.net/php5news">NEWS</a> file.</p>

        <strong>THIS IS A DEVELOPMENT PREVIEW - DO NOT USE IT IN PRODUCTION!</strong>
        <p>The purpose of this alpha release is to encourage users to not only actively
         participate in identifying bugs, but also in ensuring that all new features or
         necessary backwards compatibility breaks are noted in the documentation. Please
         report any findings to the <a href="mailto:php-qa@lists.php.net">QA mailinglist</a>
         or the <a href="http://bugs.php.net">bug tracker</a>.</p>
        <p>There have been a great number of other additions and improvements, but here is a short overview of the most important changes:</p>
        <ul>

          <li><a href="http://php.net/language.namespaces">Namespaces</a> (documentation maybe out dated)</li>
          <li><a href="http://php.net/oop5.late-static-bindings">Late static binding</a> and <a href="http://php.net/language.oop5.overloading">__callStatic</a></li>
          <li>
            <a href="http://wiki.php.net/rfc/closures">Lambda functions and closures</a>
          </li>

          <li>Addition of the <a href="http://php.net/book.intl">intl</a>, <a href="http://php.net/book.phar">phar</a> (phar is scheduled for some more work a head of alpha2), <a href="http://php.net/book.fileinfo">fileinfo </a> and <a href="http://php.net/book.sqlite3">sqlite3</a> extensions</li>
          <li>Optional cyclic garbage collection</li>

          <li>Optional support for the <a href="http://forge.mysql.com/wiki/PHP_MYSQLND">MySQLnd</a> replacement driver for libmysql</li>
          <li>Windows older than Windows 2000 (Windows 98, NT4, etc.) are not supported anymore (<a href="http://wiki.php.net/internals/windows/releasenotes">details</a>)</li>
          <li>New syntax features like <a href="http://php.net/language.types.string#language.types.string.syntax.nowdoc">NOWDOC</a>, limited GOTO, ternary short cut "?:"</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Several under the hood changes also require in depth testing with existing applications to ensure that any backwards compatibility breaks are minimized. This is especially important for users that require the undocumented Zend engine multibyte support.</p>
        <p>The current <a href="http://wiki.php.net/todo/php53">release plan</a> states that there will be alpha/beta/RC releases in 2-3 week intervals with an expected stable release of PHP 5.3 between mid September and mid October of 2008.</p>

        <p>Overall 158 tests have been submitted as part of <a href="http://qa.php.net/testfest.php">TestFest 2008</a> since the launch of the <a href="http://testfest.php.net">TestFest submission site</a> by 30 different people from people all over the world. Actually this is not counting the various submissions by existing core developers, who also took this opportunity to add some more tests. This has actually increased total <a href="http://gcov.php.net/" target="_new">test coverage</a> for ext/reflection, ext/dom and ext/exif by about 10% each. While the organization of the TestFest was a bit adhoc, there were numerous TestFest events in local user groups. So the number of people exposed to the PHP test framework is much greater. Hopefully this will lead to more people submitting bug reports with an accompanying <a href="http://qa.php.net/write-test.php">phpt</a> test file!</p>

        <p>Our top submitter Felix De Vliegher has actually committed his last submissions himself since, based on the high quality of his submissions, he has been granted commit rights to the PHP repository. We have not heard back from all participants, but we encourage everybody to <a href="http://www.deshong.net/?p=76" target="_new">blog</a> about their experience and provide us with feedback on how to improve future events.</p>
        <p>Now better late than never, here are the 10 winners of the promised <a href="http://flickr.com/groups/elephpants/pool/">elePHPant</a> raffle sponsored by <a href="http://www.nexen.net">Nexen</a>. Note that Felix asked me not to include him in the raffle, since he is already herding quite a number of elePHPants at home.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Eric Stewart</li>

          <li>Håvard Eide</li>
          <li>Marc Veldman</li>
          <li>Michelangelo van Dam</li>
          <li>Rein Velt</li>
          <li>Rob Young</li>
          <li>Sami Greenbury</li>

          <li>Sebastian Deutsch</li>
          <li>Sebastian Schürmann</li>
          <li>Stefan Koopmanschap</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We will provide Nexen with the email addresses of the winners, so that they can arrange to get the elePHPants shipped. Also for those people wondering, you can continue to submit tests on the <a href="http://testfest.php.net">TestFest submission site</a>. A bit thank you to all participants and TestFest organizers! Without the countless people that helped organize local events, implement the infrastructure and submissions reviewers, the TestFest would have obviously not worked out as well as it has. We will surely do similar events in the future based on the big success of TestFest 2008.</p>

        <a href="http://www.php.net/pdo.prepared-statements">per-extension chapters</a>
        and <a href="http://www.php.net/haru.examples">usage examples</a> along with
        <a href="http://www.php.net/class.xmlreader">improved documentation</a> for
        <a href="http://www.php.net/oop5/">object oriented</a> extensions.
       </p>

        <p>
        The most noticable changes are the <a href="http://www.php.net/funcref">function reference</a>,
        <a href="http://www.php.net/reserved.variables">predefined variables</a>,
        <a href="http://www.php.net/context">context options and parameters</a> and
        <a href="http://www.php.net/reserved.exceptions">predefined exceptions</a> manual pages,
        for which <a href="http://www.php.net/contact">we would really appreciate feedback</a> on.
       </p>

        <p>
        The upcomming PHP5.3 release introduces
        <a href="http://wiki.php.net/doc/scratchpad/upgrade/53">several major features</a>
        such as <a href="http://www.php.net/namespaces">namespaces</a>, closures,
        <a href="http://www.php.net/lsb">late static bindings</a>, <a href="http://www.php.net/intl">internationalization functions</a>,
        <a href="http://www.php.net/ini.sections">INI sections</a>, and <a href="http://www.php.net/phar">Phar</a> among others.
        We would really appreciate any and all help we can get improving the documentation.
       </p>

        <p>The PHP-QA team would like to announce the
        <a href="http://qa.php.net/testfest.php">TestFest</a> for the month of
        May 2008. The TestFest is an event that aims at improving the
        <a href="http://gcov.php.net">code coverage</a> of the
        <a href="http://qa.php.net/running-tests.php">test suite</a> for the PHP
        language itself. As part of this event, local User Groups (UG) are
        invited to join the TestFest. These UGs can meet physically or come
        together virtually. The point however is that people network to learn
        together. Aside from being an opportunity for all of you to make friends
        with like minded people in your (virtual) community, it also will
        hopefully reduce the work load for the PHP.net mentors.</p>

        <p>All it takes is someone to organize a UG to spearhead the event and
        to get others involved in
        <a href="http://qa.php.net/write-test.php">writing phpt tests</a>.
        The submissions will then be reviewed by members of php.net before
        getting included in the official test suite. Please visit the
        <a href="http://qa.php.net/testfest.php">TestFest homepage</a> to get
        additional details on the TestFest on how to get involved, either as a
        UG or by setting up the necessary infrastructure.</p>

     <p> 
     The <a href="http://conference.phpnw.org.uk">PHP North West
     Conference</a> has announced its return for a second year, to be held
     on Saturday 10th October 2009 in Manchester, UK.  This is a one-day
     conference aimed at developers from the local region and further
     afield, with a deliberately low ticket price to ensure everyone who
     wants to attend can do so.  We combine experienced speakers with some
     new local talent to bring an event that truly has something for
     everyone and a great buzz.
     </p> 
     <p> 
     The official conference is on the Saturday but there are social events
     on Friday and Saturday and an informal schedule on Sunday, so come and
     make a weekend of it with us in Manchester!  All the venues are in
     central Manchester and walkable from mainline public transport, so do
     join us.
     </p> 
     <p> 
     There is a call for papers which runs until 16th August 2009 and the
     early bird ticket prices are fixed until September 10th.  For more
     information, to submit a paper, to buy tickets, or to contact the
     organisers please visit the <a href="http://conference.phpnw.org.uk">conference website</a>.

      The migration from CVS to Subversion is complete.  The web interface is at
      <a href="http://svn.php.net">svn.php.net</a>.  You can read about it at
      <a href="http://php.net/svn.php">php.net/svn.php</a>, 
      <a href="http://wiki.php.net/vcs/svnfaq">wiki.php.net/vcs/svnfaq</a>.  The
      URL to feed to your svn client is http://svn.php.net/repository.  
     </p> 
     <p> 
      There is also a <a href="http://github.com/php">github mirror</a>.  Please
      use that instead of trying to do a full git clone from the svn repository.  See
      the instructions at <a href="http://wiki.php.net/vcs/svnfaq#git">wiki.php.net/vcs/svnfaq#git</a> 
     </p> 
     <p> 
      Many thanks to Gwynne who did the bulk of the work and also all the other folks who pitched in.
      It was a major effort to move 14 years of CVS history to another RCS.

      So finally we are at the end of the
      <a href="http://wiki.php.net/qa/testfest">2009 PHP TestFest</a>.
      It has been an outstanding success with the
      <a href="http://gcov.php.net/PHP_5_3/lcov_html/">coverage increasing</a> 
      by about 2.5% overall and 887 new tests contributed in the TestFest SVN
      repository of which 637 have already been added to PHP CVS.
     </p> 
     <p> 
      <a href="http://wiki.php.net/usergroups">User groups</a> from all
      over the world have worked hard to make this happen and we thank
      <a href="http://results.testfest.php.net">each and every one of you</a> 
      for your contribution to PHP!
      You really made a difference to the PHP5.3 release quality.
     </p> 
     <p> 
      There still are few loose ends to tie up - the
      <a href="http://testfest.php.net/repos/testfest/">TestFest SVN repository</a> 
      will be <em>closed</em> for contributions later this week and the last few
      tests will be moved into the main PHP repository. Finally, we have
      <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?w=all&amp;q=elephpants&amp;m=tags">10 elePHPants</a> 
      and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?w=all&amp;q=testfest+mug&amp;m=tags">9 TestFest mugs</a> 
      to give out. The winners of mugs and elePHPants
      will be drawn at random from a list of people who wrote tests;
      the winner\'s names will be announced later this month.
     </p> 
     <p> 
      For those that would like to continue to make a difference by
      writing tests there are two options. You can simply continue by
      submitting new tests to the <a href="http://php.net/mailinglists">QA mailing list</a>,
      or, if you have written a significant number of tests you might
      consider applying for your own
      <a href="http://php.net/cvs-php">PHP CVS (or SVN) ID</a>.
      In your application you should reference the tests that you have
      written in support of your application.
     </p> 
     <p> 
      Last but not least, we would  like to thank all of the
      companies and institutions that sponsored TestFest.
      These include Combell, Corretgé, Faculdade Impacta de Tecnologia, IBM,
      iBuildings, Itera, Mayflower, Microsoft, Nexen (Alter Way Group), php|architect,
      Redpill-Linpro, Steinigke Showtechnic, Verges Council and Zend.

        TestFest is upon us once again. For those who don\'t know, this is the
        time of year where User Groups and individuals donate a little of their
        time and effort to increasing the test coverage of PHP.
      </p> 
      <p> 
        Hundreds of thousands of lines of code are working in concert to
        assemble one of the simplest to learn and fastest running scripting
        languages in the business. All this is achieved with the expectation
        that very few bugs will make it into releases and the ones that do
        will be stomped out quickly, efficiently and will never be heard from
        again. This is a lofty goal and is only possible through a system of
        tests designed to continuously evaluate the well-being of PHP.
      </p> 
      <p> 
        This year the QA Team has been very busy implementing new features
        and improvements to make the TestFest experience easier and more
        enjoyable than ever before. Some these improvements include a
        Subversion repository for test storage and tracking, a Virtual
        Machine for simple test environment setup, and improved documentation
        of testing procedures.
      </p> 
      <p> 
        2009 is looking to be the most successful TestFest event ever. Over
        20 User Groups spanning Belgium, Brazil, Catalonia, Canada, France,
        Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Peru, USA and the UK
        have already registered. This is an incredible response and we still
        have 2 months left to go.
      </p> 
      <p> 
        Getting involved couldn\'t be simpler. Visit the
        <a href="http://qa.php.net/testfest.php">QA TestFest page</a> to
        find out how you can organize a TestFest event in your community.
        We are looking forward to seeing your communities tests being
        committed into PHP.

     <p> 
      The PHP development team is proud to announce the second release candidate of PHP 5.3.0 (PHP 5.3.0RC2). 
      This RC focuses on bug fixes and stability improvements, and we hope only minimal changes are required 
      for the next candidate (RC3).
     </p> 
     <p> 
      Expect an RC3 in 2-3 weeks, although there will not be major changes so now is a good
      time to start the final testing of PHP 5.3.0 before it gets released, in order to find
      possible incompatibilities with your project.
     </p> 
     <p> 
      Please download and test this release candidate, and report any issues found.
      Downloads and further information is available at <a href="http://qa.php.net/">qa.php.net</a>.

      <p>The PHP development team is proud to announce the availability of the first release candidate of PHP 5.3.0 (PHP 5.3.0RC1). This release marks the final phase in a major improvement in the 5.X series, which includes a large number of new features, bug fixes and security enhancements.</p> 
      <p>The key features of the PHP 5.3 branch include:</p> 
      <ul> 
        <li>Support for <a href="http://php.net/namespaces">namespaces</a></li> 
        <li>Under the hood performance improvements</li>

         <a href="http://php.net/__callstatic">__callStatic()</a> 
        </li> 
        <li>Optional <a href="http://php.net/gc_enable">garbage collection</a> for cyclic references</li>

        <li>Improved <a href="http://windows.php.net">windows</a> support including VC6 and VC9 binaries</li> 
        <li>More consistent float rounding</li> 
        <li>Deprecation notices are now handle via E_DEPRECATED (part of E_ALL) instead of the E_STRICT error level</li> 
        <li>Several enhancements to enable more <a href="http://php.net/ini.sections">flexiblity in php.ini</a> (and ini parsing in general)</li> 
        <li>New bundled extensions:
         <a href="http://php.net/phar">ext/phar</a>,
         <a href="http://php.net/intl">ext/intl</a>,
         <a href="http://php.net/fileinfo">ext/fileinfo</a>,
         <a href="http://php.net/sqlite3">ext/sqlite3</a>,
         <a href="http://php.net/enchant">ext/enchant</a> 
        </li> 
        <li>Countless bug fixes and improvements to existing extensions in particular to:
         <a href="http://php.net/openssl">ext/openssl</a>,
         <a href="http://php.net/spl">ext/spl</a> and
         <a href="http://php.net/datetime">ext/date</a> 
        </li> 
      </ul> 
      <p>This release also drops several extensions and unifies usage of internal APIs. Users should be aware of the following known backwards compatibility breaks:</p> 
      <ul> 
        <li>Parameter parsing API unification will cause some functions to behave more or less strict when it comes to type juggling</li> 
        <li>Removed the following extensions:
         <a href="http://php.net/mhash">ext/mhash</a> (see <a href="http://php.net/hash">ext/hash</a>),
         <a href="http://php.net/msql">ext/msql</a>,

         <a href="http://php.net/sybase">ext/sybase</a> (see <a href="http://php.net/sybase">ext/sybase_ct</a>)
        </li> 
        <li>Moved the following extensions to PECL:
         <a href="http://php.net/ming">ext/ming</a>,
         <a href="http://php.net/fbsql">ext/fbsql</a>,

        </li> 
        <li>Removed <a href="http://php.net/manual/ini.core.php#ini.zend.ze1-compatibility-mode">zend.ze1_compatibility_mode</a></li> 
        <li>See the <a href="http://cvs.php.net/viewvc.cgi/php-src/UPGRADING?view=markup&amp;pathrev=PHP_5_3">upgrading guide</a> for other minor changes</li> 
      </ul> 
      <p>All users of PHP, especially those using earlier PHP 5 releases are advised to test this release as the final release of PHP 5.3.0 will eventually obsolete the 5.2 branch of PHP.</p> 
      <p>For users upgrading from previous PHP 5 releases there is an upgrading guide available <a href="http://cvs.php.net/viewvc.cgi/php-src/UPGRADING?view=markup&amp;pathrev=PHP_5_3">here</a>, detailing the changes between those releases and PHP 5.3.0.</p> 
      <p>Please also note that we are aware of issues surrounding float/integer handling in some edge cases (some of which have been introduced in PHP 5.2.0), as well as a crash bug in NSAPI, that will be fixed in PHP 5.3.0RC2. These issues however do not prevent wide spread testing of PHP 5.3.0RC1 as users can now rely on the feature set and implementation decisions no longer being changed.</p> 
      <p>For a full list of changes in PHP 5.3.0, see the CVS <a href="http://cvs.php.net/viewvc.cgi/php-src/NEWS?view=markup&amp;pathrev=PHP_5_3">NEWS</a> file.</p>

     <p>Not just another conference - this year has seen some high-valued
     conferences (like our IPC Spring Edition in Berlin) and we are already
     preparing the next big PHP conference. But this year makes a difference.
     It\'s the 10th. anniversary of the International PHP Conference. Being in
     business for ten years, we met some great people, made true fans and
     encouraged PHP developers all over the world to commit their passion for
     web-development to a growing community, that is behind some of the most
     well-known websites today.</p> 
     
     <p>Of course, a great event is nothing without great developers and we are very
     happy to welcome the PHP community to our next International PHP Conference
     2010! Again, this conference is packed with workshops, sessions and keynotes
     on some of the most trending topics in PHP and web development today. Wether
     you are the developer dealing with core PHP features, the project lead that
     is in continuous integration or the CTO looking for professional solutions,
     this conference is the place to be. Not because of our 10 years of
     experience in bringing together some of the most experienced heads in PHP
     development - but because of this conference being one of Europe\'s leading
     technology events that have been made possible by a really passionate
     community. And that is ... by you.</p>

    PHP North West is a PHP conference with a regional focus, bringing the best
    of PHP speakers to the north-west of England on Saturday 9th October. A
    full day of conference speakers over at least two tracks this should again
    prove to be one of the best events for PHP user-led conferences in Europe.
    We\'re also, as last year, having an informal half day of speakers on Sunday
    10th October, at the Museum of Science and Industry (MOSI) nearby. With a
    weekend packed with all things PHP and a ticket price to suit business and
    hobbyists alike there are no reasons to miss out - see you in Manchester :)

     The PHP development team would like to announce the immediate
     availability of PHP 5.3.3. This release focuses on improving the
     stability and security of the PHP 5.3.x branch with over 100 bug
     fixes, some of which are security related. All users are encouraged
     to upgrade to this release.

     <ul> 
             <li>Methods with the same name as the last element of a namespaced class name
             will no longer be treated as constructor. This change doesn\'t affect
             non-namespaced classes.

    }<br/> 
}<br/>

        PHP is proud to announce TestFest 2010. TestFest is PHP\'s annual campaign
        to increase the overall code coverage of PHP through PHPT tests. During
        TestFest, PHP User Groups and individuals around the world organize local
        events where new tests are written and new contributors are introduced to
        PHP\'s testing suite.
      </p> 
      <p> 
        Last year was very successful with 887 tests submitted and a code coverage
        increase of 2.5%. This year we hope to do better.
      </p> 
      <p> 
        TestFest\'s own SVN repository and reporting tools are back online for this
        year\'s event. New to TestFest this year are automated test environment build
        tools as well as screencasts showing those build tools in action.
      </p> 
      <p> 
        Please visit the <a href="http://wiki.php.net/qa/testfest-2010">TestFest
        2010</a> wiki page for all the details on events being organized in your area,

       The PHP development team is proud to announce the first <a href="http://qa.php.net/">beta release</a> of PHP 5.4.
       PHP 5.4 includes new language features and removes several legacy (deprecated) behaviors.
       Windows binaries can be downloaded from the <a href="http://windows.php.net/qa/"> Windows QA site</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>THIS IS A DEVELOPMENT PREVIEW - DO NOT USE IT IN PRODUCTION!</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       New features were added and bugs were fixed since alpha1.
       Please help us to identify bugs by testing new features and looking for
       unintended backward compatability breaks, so we can fix the problems and
       fully document intended changes before PHP 5.4.0 is released.
       Report findings to the <a href="mailto:php-qa@lists.php.net">QA mailing list</a> and/or
       the <a href="https://bugs.php.net/">PHP bug tracker</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>Changes since the first alpha version include:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Added callable typehint.</li>
        <li>Removed the timezone guessing algorithm. "UTC" is now used in case the timezone is not set.</li>
        <li>The mysql, mysqli and pdo_mysql extensions now use mysqlnd by default.</li>
      </ul>

     <p>Windows users: please mind that we do no longer provide builds created
     with Visual Studio C++ 6. It is impossible to maintain a high quality
     and safe build of PHP for Windows using this unmaintained compiler.</p>
     
     <p>For Apache SAPIs (php5_apache2_2.dll), be sure that you use a Visual
     Studio C++ 9 version of Apache. We recommend the Apache builds as provided
     by <a href="http://www.apachelounge.com/">ApacheLounge</a>. For any other
     SAPI (CLI, FastCGI via mod_fcgi, FastCGI with IIS or other FastCGI capable
     server), everything works as before. Third party extension providers
     must rebuild their extensions to make them compatible and loadable with
     the Visual Studio C++9 builds that we now provide.</p>
     
     <p>All PHP users should note that the PHP 5.2 series is NOT supported
     anymore. All users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to PHP 5.3.7.</p>

     <p>The wiki.php.net box was compromised and the attackers were able to
     collect wiki account credentials. No other machines in the php.net
     infrastructure appear to have been affected. Our biggest concern is,
     of course, the integrity of our source code. We did an extensive code
     audit and looked at every commit since 5.3.5 to make sure that no stolen
     accounts were used to inject anything malicious. Nothing was found.
     The compromised machine has been wiped and we are forcing a password
     change for all svn accounts.</p>
     
     <p>We are still investigating the details of the attack which combined a
     vulnerability in the Wiki software with a Linux root exploit.</p>

     <p>The PHP development team would like to announce the immediate
     availability of PHP 5.3.6. This release focuses on improving the
     stability of the PHP 5.3.x branch with over 60 bug fixes, some of which
     are security related.</p>
     
     <p><b>Security Enhancements and Fixes in PHP 5.3.6:</b></p>
     <ul>
     <li>Enforce security in the fastcgi protocol parsing with fpm SAPI.</li>
     <li>Fixed bug #54247 (format-string vulnerability on Phar). (CVE-2011-1153)</li>
     <li>Fixed bug #54193 (Integer overflow in shmop_read()). (CVE-2011-1092)</li>
     <li>Fixed bug #54055 (buffer overrun with high values for precision ini setting).</li>
     <li>Fixed bug #54002 (crash on crafted tag in exif). (CVE-2011-0708)</li>
     <li>Fixed bug #53885 (ZipArchive segfault with FL_UNCHANGED on empty archive). (CVE-2011-0421)</li>
     </ul>
     
     <p><b>Key enhancements in PHP 5.3.6 include:</b></p>
     <ul>
     <li>Upgraded bundled Sqlite3 to version 3.7.4.</li>
     <li>Upgraded bundled PCRE to version 8.11.</li>
     <li>Added ability to connect to HTTPS sites through proxy with basic authentication using stream_context/http/header/Proxy-Authorization.</li>
     <li>Added options to debug backtrace functions.</li>
     <li>Changed default value of ini directive serialize_precision from 100 to 17.</li>
     <li>Fixed Bug #53971 (isset() and empty() produce apparently spurious runtime error).</li>
     <li>Fixed Bug #53958 (Closures can\'t \'use\' shared variables by value and by reference).</li>
     <li>Fixed bug #53577 (Regression introduced in 5.3.4 in open_basedir with a trailing forward slash).</li>
     <li>Over 60 other bug fixes.</li>
     </ul>
     
     <p>Windows users: please mind that we do no longer provide builds created
     with Visual Studio C++ 6. It is impossible to maintain a high quality
     and safe build of PHP for Windows using this unmaintained compiler.
     </p>
     
     <p>For Apache SAPIs (php5_apache2_2.dll), be sure that you use a Visual
     Studio C++ 9 version of Apache. We recommend the Apache builds as provided
     by <a href="http://www.apachelounge.com/">ApacheLounge</a>. For any other SAPI (CLI,
     FastCGI via mod_fcgi, FastCGI with IIS or other FastCGI capable
     server), everything works as before. Third party extension providers
     must rebuild their extensions to make them compatible and loadable with
     the Visual Studio C++ 9 builds that we now provide.
     </p>
     
     <p>All PHP users should note that the PHP 5.2 series is NOT supported anymore. All users
     are strongly encouraged to upgrade to PHP 5.3.6.</p>

     <p>For a full list of changes in PHP 5.3.6, see the
     <a href="http://www.php.net/ChangeLog-5.php#5.3.6">ChangeLog</a>. For source downloads
     please visit our <a href="http://www.php.net/downloads.php">downloads page</a>, Windows

      </p>
      <p>
        The PHP Community Conference is a two-day event, taking place April
        21st and 22nd, 2011 in Nashville, TN. We have an
        <a href="http://phpcon.org/speakers">awesome line-up of speakers</a>,
        including a keynote address by <strong>Rasmus Lerdorf</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We\'ll kick things off with a tutorial day that will introduce you
        to tools and ideas that you can use in your code right away. The
        second day will consist of presentations that will inspire you to
        create something new with PHP. With the help of our sponsors, we
        are able to offer admission to the entire event for $350 USD. We\'ll
        provide lunch and snacks on both days. On Friday night, we\'ll
        finish off the conference with a party featuring
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pecha_Kucha">pecha kucha</a>

     The PHP development team would like to announce the immediate
     availability of PHP <a href="http://www.php.net/releases/5_3_5.php">5.3.5</a> and <a href="http://www.php.net/releases/5_2_17.php">5.2.17</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
     This release resolves a critical issue, reported as PHP bug #53632 and
     CVE-2010-4645, where conversions from string to double might cause the PHP
     interpreter to hang on systems using x87 FPU registers.
    </p>
    <p>
     The problem is known to only affect x86 32-bit PHP processes, regardless
     of whether the system hosting PHP is 32-bit or 64-bit. You can test
     whether your system is affected by running <a href="http://www.php.net/distributions/test_bug53632.txt">this script</a>
     from the command line.
    </p>
    <p>
     All users of PHP are strongly advised to update to these versions
     immediately.
